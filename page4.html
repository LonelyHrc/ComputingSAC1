			<dl>
				<dt>What is your chosen infographic topic and why is this a topic you wish to research?</dt>
				<br>
				<dd>The chosen topic is the impact of COVID-19 on students in terms of their academic development. We have decided to investigate this topic and gather related information because the fact that COVID-19 and lockdowns had contradictory effects on different students, which is rather interesting. It is also relevant to our own life and the current outbreak of it here in Melbourne. Ultimately, now, after 2 years of pandemic, Victoria's policies against Covid have dramatically eased. It is particularly a meaningful moment to explore whether this ease of policy actually impacts students positively or negatively.</dd>
				<br><br>
				<dt>Purpose of the infographic website - Persuade, Inform or Entertain? What does it aim to achieve?</dt>
				<br>
				<dd>The purpose of this infographic website is to present information on how the outbreak of coronavirus has influenced student's academic results. It aims to examine how the sudden outbreak of a pandemic has affected students' emotions and the correlation between academic results. </dd>
				<br><br>
				<dt>Intended audience - Describe the type of students this infographic is targeted towards and why, eg age group, ethnicity, gender, interests, etc</dt>
				<br>
				<dd>The intended audience of our infographic is targeted to teenagers around our age, parents, and people that work in the education field. Because we believe that for students, it will inform them that they are most likely not the only one feeling the way they feel, and gaining a sense of comfort, for parents it could help them to understand their children and how they are feeling to better assist them. And lastly for people who work in the field of education, our infographic will provide an insight of how student went with study during lockdowns, students' experience with online learning, and how student cope with stress, these information could help educators to alter their strategy in preparation for the next lockdown, or even make plans for regular online classes.  </dd>
				<br><br>
				<dt>What information based on primary data are you aiming to collect and present on your infographic?</dt>
				<br>
				<dd>Based on our primary data, we are aiming to collect people's attitude towards online learning, people's attitudes towards online learning, and how happy they were with their general grades for the past two years. (on a scale of 1 to 5, one being negative, and 5 being very positive), if they think online learning is a good way to learn even without COVID?(yes or no), any other suggestions that they could make to educators about coping with covid for the past two years. </dd>
				<br><br>
				<dt>What information based on secondary data are you aiming to research and present on your website?</dt>
				<br>
				<dd>We are aiming to utilise some of the articles and reports that we can find online on reliable and trustworthy websites such as government organisations, survey results obtained by other organisations and peer reviewed research papers, to present on our website. This will increase the reliability of the information. And we will use the secondary data to either support or disprove our primary data, and find correlations between the two</dd>
				<br><br>
				<dt>What will you do to ensure the integrity of your primary and secondary data (i.e reliable and free from bias)?</dt>
				<br>
				<dd>In order to ensure the integrity of our primary data, we are trying to develop a set of questions which evaluates a student's learning outcome with minimal bias which might originate from personal opinion and feelings. For example, we might ask ons grade but since anyone may make this up, we can use a set of questions to identify how reliable the person's answer is.  For example, we are planning to implement a set of questions (e.g. find derivative of something) which can be used to weigh the person's input grade and promote the integrity of the data. Speaking of secondary data, we have to rely on governmental data provided by VCAA, which is quite reliable and is used by every education related application. </dd>
				<br><br>
				<dt>What will you do to ensure the ethical collection, storage and use of primary collected data?</dt>
				<br>
				<dd>We protect data security and ethnicity by ensuring that data will not be passed onto others. Moreover, we will gather information upon whether people consent for the data collection, and will also inform them in the survey that the result will be used anonymously in an infographic that will only be presented to JMSS students and teachers. Lastly, we will store data in a file that's inaccessible to unauthorised persons, and will have a password to protect it. </dd>
