			<p>
				The following website and infographic is about COVID-19's impact on students in terms of their academic development. <br><br>
We have decided to investigate this topic and gather related information to look at the COVID-19 lockdowns, which had varying effects on different students, which is rather interesting. 

			</p>
			<div class="subtitle">Purpose</div>
			<p>
				The purpose of this infographic website is to present information on how the outbreak of Coronavirus has influenced student's academic results, wellbeing and attitude towards learning. It aims to examine how the sudden outbreak of a pandemic has affected students' emotions and the correlation between academic results. It will provide information on ways that students learn the best and how teachers could further assist students to bring out the best in them.
			</p>
			<div class="subtitle">How and who will benefit from it</div>
			<p>
				If you work in the education field, are a parent or a teenager aged between 13-18, then you are in the right place to look! Our infographic will inform you how teenagers have felt under the impact of COVID-19. <br><br>
				For teenagers, you will be able to see the opinions and statistics from students your age, and hopefully gain a sense of comfort through knowing that you are not the only one under all this pressure. <br><br>
				For parents, this website can help you understand your children's feelings and better assist and support them through tough times. <br><br>
				For people who work in the field of education, our infographic will provide an insight of how students went with study during lockdowns, students' experience with online learning, and how students cope with stress. This information can help educators alter strategies in preparation for future lockdowns, or even make plans for regular online classes.  

			</p>
			<div class="subtitle">What's on our website</div>
			
			<p>
				On our website, you will be able to access the infographic that we have made using primary data that we collected and reliable secondary data sources. On the "Students' opinions" page, suggestions about online teaching, and their feelings about lockdowns that students have provided have been presented. We have also included the survey questions we used and the proposal of the topic of investigation. And on our last page, it has the conclusion drawn from the investigation and our bibliography.
