				Many students from John Monash have given honest opinions regarding the impact of Covid-19 and learning strategies. They are given down below:
			</p>
			<div class="student">Student A</div>

			<p>
				For the online videos, they should have just posted that online somewhere, and students can access it when they want to so that there is more freedom on time management. The only thing the students had to be present in real time for was tests and random social gatherings so that we can still socialise. Students could communicate to teachers about who they wanted to be in a group with and when those social sessions were in place the teachers could put students into groups, allowing people to talk with people of their choice.  They could also have get-to-know you activities like personality tests or 21 questions or things like that would make online learning way more enjoyable.

			<p>
				Be more flexible
			</p>
			<div class="student">Student C</div>

			<p>
				Include some offline days so that students arenâ€™t overwhelmed with consecutive days of screen time, and they will have time to go outside and relax their minds a little bit.

			</p>
			<div class="student">Student D</div>
			<p>
				Have small workshops to help students in need. <br><br>
				These opinions are all suggesting ways for teachers to plan the classes to help students to either have a healthier mental health or to be able to study better. There are also students commenting that lockdowns have worsened their motivation to put effort into things, I am sure with many of the new strategies suggested, if there has to be another round of lockdowns John Monash will be very well prepared and students will have little complaints about online classes.
