				 In conclusion, Covid-19 has had a significant impact on most students in Victoria,  negatively affecting stress and anxiety. However, from the primary data collected using surveys from JMSS students, it can be seen that only a small portion (4%) of students felt that their attitude toward study has been affected negatively, showing how JMSS has been helping students to feel more comfortable in learning during lockdowns, and that most students had enough support for their attitude to change positively. 
				 <br><br>
It should be noted that for the primary data collection, we were only able to collect data from 25 students in the JMSS cohort. With most of them being y11 students. The small sample size would mean that it is not reliable enough to represent the whole of JMSS. Additionally, because all year 11s have experienced a recent school change, it would have impacted their attitude towards learning. <br><br>
It is out of our groups' expectation, that up to 44% of JMSS students said that their attitude towards learning was unchanged over the times of lockdowns. But it could also mean that this particular sample group - year 11 computing students, were very good at adapting to change.
